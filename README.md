## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **Jest** - Testing framework
- **No Framework** - Vanilla DOM manipulation (lightweight, educational)
- **LocalStorage** - Save system (browser-based persistence)

## Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID principles**:

```
UI Layer (DOM only, no game logic)
    ‚Üì
Command Layer (orchestrates services)
    ‚Üì
Service Layer (all game logic)
    ‚Üì
Data Layer (immutable state, JSON config)
```

**Key Principles**:
- **Immutability** - Never mutate state, always return new objects
- **Dependency Injection** - All services receive dependencies via constructor
- **Single Responsibility** - Each service/command has one job
- **Testability** - 80%+ coverage with deterministic tests (MockRandom)

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for complete architecture guidelines.

## Development

### Testing

```bash
npm test                # Run all tests
npm run test:watch      # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # Coverage report
```

**Coverage Goals**:
- Services: >90% (pure logic)
- Commands: >80% (orchestration)
- Overall: >80%

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run type-check
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

# Documentation Refactor Plan

**Status**: 🚧 In Progress
**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-06
**Owner**: Dirk Kok

---

## Objectives

1. **Apply SOLID Principles to Documentation** - Split "god documents" into focused, single-responsibility files
2. **Eliminate Duplication (DRY)** - Establish single sources of truth for key concepts
3. **Improve Discoverability** - Create clear entry points and navigation paths
4. **Enhance Onboarding** - Provide guided learning paths for new developers
5. **Ensure Maintainability** - Keep documents under 500 lines for easy updates

---

## Context & Related Documentation

**Violates Current Principles**:
- [CLAUDE.md - SOLID Principles](../../CLAUDE.md#solid-principles) - Documentation should follow same principles as code
- [CLAUDE.md - DRY](../../CLAUDE.md#dry-dont-repeat-yourself) - Duplicate content across multiple docs

**Current Issues Identified**:
- `services.md` - 1,745 lines (god document)
- `commands.md` - 2,619 lines (god document)
- `CLAUDE.md` - 874 lines (too large)
- Service responsibilities listed in 4+ places (duplication)
- No master entry point (docs/README.md missing)
- Plan files mixed with permanent docs

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ No document >500 lines (except architecture.md - acceptable at 1,224)
- ✅ Each concept documented in ONE place only
- ✅ Clear onboarding path for new developers
- ✅ All cross-references updated and working

---

## Analysis Summary

### Current State

#### Strengths ✅
- Good modular structure (separate folders for game-design/, services/, commands/)
- SOLID principles applied to game-design docs (50-150 lines each)
- Comprehensive coverage of all systems
- Real code examples throughout
- Cross-references between documents

#### Critical Issues ❌

1. **God Documents (Violates SRP)**
   - `services.md`: 1,745 lines → Should be 4 focused docs (~400 lines each)
   - `commands.md`: 2,619 lines → Should be 4 focused docs (~400 lines each)
   - `CLAUDE.md`: 874 lines → Should be ~500 lines

2. **Duplication (Violates DRY)**
   - Service responsibilities listed in: services.md, CLAUDE.md, architecture.md, services/README.md
   - Testing patterns repeated in: CLAUDE.md, testing-strategy.md, services.md, commands.md
   - SOLID principles explained in: CLAUDE.md, architecture.md, ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW.md
   - File organization repeated in: CLAUDE.md, architecture.md, testing-strategy.md

3. **Poor Navigation**
   - No docs/README.md (master index)
   - No clear beginner → advanced learning path
   - Hard to know where to start

4. **Missing Documents**
   - getting-started.md (onboarding)
   - contributing.md (workflow)
   - troubleshooting.md (common issues)

5. **Organization Issues**
   - Completed plan files (light_source_plan.md, etc.) mixed with permanent docs
   - Inconsistent "Last Updated" dates
   - No document status tracking (complete/in-progress/archived)

### Task 6.2: Verify Document Sizes

**Context**: Ensure no documents exceed target sizes

  ```bash
  wc -l docs/*.md docs/**/*.md
  ```

- [ ] Verify:
  - No document >500 lines (except architecture.md)

- [ ] If any document too large, split further

- [ ] Git commit (if needed): "docs: further split oversized documents (Phase 6.2)"

---

### Task 6.3: Update Main README.md

**Context**: Project root README should link to docs

#### Subtasks:
- [ ] Update `/README.md` (project root) to link to docs:
  ```markdown
  ## Documentation

  - **[Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md)** - New developer onboarding
  - **[Documentation Index](./docs/README.md)** - Full documentation map
  - **[Contributing](./docs/contributing.md)** - How to contribute
  - **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** - Claude Code quick reference
  ```

- [ ] Git commit: "docs: update root README to link documentation (Phase 6.3)"

---

### Task 6.4: Create Documentation Changelog

**Context**: Track what changed in this refactor

#### Subtasks:
- [ ] Create `docs/CHANGELOG.md`:
  ```markdown
  # Documentation Changelog

  ## 2025-10-06 - Major Refactor (v2.0)

  ### Breaking Changes
  - Split `services.md` (1,745 lines) into 4 focused documents
  - Split `commands.md` (2,619 lines) into 4 focused documents
  - Condensed `CLAUDE.md` (874 → 500 lines)

  ### New Documents
  - `docs/README.md` - Master documentation index
  - `docs/getting-started.md` - New developer onboarding
  - `docs/contributing.md` - Contribution workflow
  - `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Common issues
  - Quick reference cards for services, commands, testing

  ### Improvements
  - Eliminated duplication across documents (DRY)
  - Established single sources of truth
  - Standardized headers across all docs
  - Added breadcrumb navigation
  - Organized completed plans into docs/plans/

  ### Migration Guide
  - `services.md` → See `services/README.md` for overview
  - `commands.md` → See `commands/README.md` for overview
  - For detailed guides, see respective creation-guide.md files
  ```

- [ ] Git commit: "docs: add CHANGELOG documenting refactor (Phase 6.4)"

- [ ] All cross-references updated
- [ ] No broken links
- [ ] All line count targets met
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md created

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during refactor:

1. **Rollback via Git**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline  # Find commit before refactor
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

2. **Partial Rollback**:
   - Each phase has independent commits
   - Can rollback specific phases without affecting others

3. **Deprecation Notices**:
   - If old docs must remain temporarily, add deprecation notice:
   ```markdown
   > ⚠️ **DEPRECATED**: This document has been split. See [new location](./new-doc.md)
   ```

---

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1 (Split God Documents)**: 8-12 hours
- **Phase 2 (Create Entry Points)**: 4-6 hours
- **Phase 3 (Remove Duplication)**: 4-6 hours
- **Phase 4 (Improve Navigation)**: 3-4 hours
- **Phase 5 (Organize Historical)**: 1-2 hours
- **Phase 6 (Final Verification)**: 2-3 hours

**Total**: 22-33 hours (~3-5 days of focused work)

---

## Post-Refactor Maintenance

1. **Update docs/CHANGELOG.md** for any future doc changes
2. **Verify links monthly** (automated tool recommended)
3. **Review "Last Updated"** dates quarterly
4. **Archive completed plans** immediately after features ship
5. **Maintain line count targets** (<500 lines per doc)

---

## Notes & Considerations

- **Minimize disruption**: Complete each phase fully before starting next
- **Atomic commits**: One commit per subtask for easy rollback
- **Communication**: Update team when old doc locations change
- **Deprecation period**: Consider leaving old docs with redirects for 1 week
- **Automation opportunity**: Consider link checker CI job after refactor

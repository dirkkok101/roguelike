## Overview

This plan outlines the 8-phase development roadmap for the ASCII Roguelike. Each phase builds on the previous, with clear deliverables and success criteria.

**Estimated Timeline**: 11 weeks total (assumes single developer, ~20-30 hours/week)

**Current Status**: Phases 1-6 complete (100%), Phase 7 (Win Condition & Polish) not started

### Recent Architectural Improvements (2025-10-04)

âœ… **Completed comprehensive debug system (Phase 1 now 100% complete):**
- Implemented DebugService with 14 methods (686 lines)
- Created 9 debug commands with 100% test coverage
- Built DebugConsole UI component (224 lines) with real-time stats display
- Built DebugOverlays renderer (155 lines) for visual debugging
- Integrated god mode into CombatService to prevent damage in debug mode
- Added 7 comprehensive test files (56 tests, all passing)
- Wired 9 debug key bindings into InputHandler (~, g, v, m, M, K, f, p, n)
- **Test Results**: 1025 total tests passing (56 new debug tests added)

âœ… **Completed comprehensive architectural refactoring:**
- Reorganized 9 commands + DungeonService into folder structure with barrel exports
- Standardized all imports to use path aliases (@game/*, @services/*, @commands/*)
- Extracted exploration tracking logic from MoveCommand to FOVService
- Improved architecture compliance: commands orchestrate, services contain logic

âœ… **Completed door system implementation:**
- Fixed door placement bug: doors now on wall tiles (not floor tiles) - commit f1a12aa
- Fixed walkability bug: CLOSED/LOCKED doors now correctly block movement
- Implemented auto-open (bump-to-open) behavior for CLOSED doors - commit 980519f
- LOCKED doors block movement until key system (deferred to Phase 5+)
- Added 18 comprehensive door tests (door-interaction.test.ts + DungeonService tests)
- All tests passing: 66/66 suites, 787/787 tests

**Impact**: Better separation of concerns, improved maintainability, architecture now fully compliant with design guidelines. Door mechanics now match game design specification.

  - Non-intrusive flash at bottom of screen

**Tests**: 100% coverage (context-analysis.test.ts, notifications.test.ts)

#### Phase B: UI Components (Complete)
- [x] **ContextualCommandBar** - Dynamic command bar
  - Shows context-aware commands based on player position
  - Displays primary hints (item here, door nearby)
  - Shows warnings (inventory full, low health, hunger)
  - Color-coded actions (green=primary, blue=secondary)
  - Full-width layout spanning browser width
- [x] **MessageHistoryModal** - Full message history viewer
  - Press `Ctrl+M` to view all messages
  - Infinite scrollback with turn numbers

- [x] **Message Importance** - Priority-based display
  - Messages tagged with importance levels (1-5)
  - Critical messages prioritized in display
  - Future: basis for smart filtering

**Tests**: 100% coverage (message-grouping.test.ts, message-importance.test.ts)

#### Phase D: Integration & Keybindings (Complete)

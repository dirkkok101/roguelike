## Consumption Behavior

### Consumed on Read (10 scrolls)
All scrolls are removed from inventory after reading **except**:

### NOT Consumed (1 scroll)
- **Scare Monster** - Must be dropped on ground to take effect
  - Returns `consumed: false` from ScrollService
  - DropCommand places scroll at player position
  - Tracks `droppedAtTurn` for deterioration

---

## Fizzle Mechanics

**Fizzle** = Scroll fails to work (no effect, returns to inventory, no turn consumed)

### Fizzle Conditions

| Scroll | Fizzles When |
|--------|--------------|
| **Identify** | No target item provided |
| **Enchant Weapon** | Weapon already at +3 enchantment |
| **Enchant Armor** | Armor already at +3 enchantment |
| **Teleportation** | No walkable tiles on level (extremely rare) |
| **Create Monster** | No adjacent empty space (surrounded) |
| **Light** | Player in corridor (not room) |
| **Hold Monster** | No adjacent monster |
| **Remove Curse** | No cursed items equipped |

### Never Fizzle
- Magic Mapping (always reveals map)
- Sleep (always curses player)
- Scare Monster (always activates)

## Strategic Tips

### Early Game (Levels 1-3)
1. **Identify unknown items** first (rings, wands most valuable)
2. **Hold unidentified scrolls** until you find good equipment
3. **Don't waste enchantment scrolls** on weak starting gear
4. **Be cautious** reading scrolls in dangerous areas (Sleep risk!)

### Mid Game (Levels 4-7)
1. **Enchant your best weapon** first (usually Two-handed Sword or Long Sword)
2. **Enchant heavy armor** (Plate Mail, Splint Mail)
3. **Use Magic Mapping** on large/confusing levels
4. **Save Teleportation scrolls** for emergency escapes

### Late Game (Levels 8-10)
1. **Maximize equipment** to +3 bonus
2. **Keep Remove Curse** scrolls (high curse rate in deep dungeon)
3. **Use Scare Monster** tactically to create safe zones
4. **Hold Monster** powerful enemies (Dragons, Trolls)

### Survival Tips
- **Never read unidentified scrolls** when:
  - Low on HP (Sleep/Create Monster could be fatal)
  - Surrounded by monsters (Create Monster = death)
  - In trap-heavy area (Sleep + traps = bad time)
- **Always have escape options**:
  - Keep 1-2 Teleportation scrolls
  - Know where stairs are (Magic Mapping helps)
- **Scare Monster is reusable** - place strategically!

## Technical Implementation

### ScrollEffectResult Type

```typescript
interface ScrollEffectResult {
  player?: Player      // Updated player state (enchantment, status effects, position)
  state?: GameState    // Updated game state (level modifications)
  message: string      // User-facing message
  identified: boolean  // Was scroll previously unidentified?
  fizzled?: boolean    // Did scroll fail? (no effect, no turn consumed)
  consumed: boolean    // Remove scroll from inventory? (false for SCARE_MONSTER)
}
```

### State Modification Patterns

| Pattern | Scrolls |
|---------|---------|
| **Player Only** | SLEEP (status effect), Enchant Weapon/Armor (inventory) |
| **State Only** | MAGIC_MAPPING (level exploration), CREATE_MONSTER (level monsters) |
| **Both** | TELEPORTATION (player position + FOV update), LIGHT (level explored + FOV) |
| **Neither** | IDENTIFY (identification state only) |

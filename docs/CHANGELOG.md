### Improvements

**DRY Principle Applied** (Phase 3):
- ✅ Eliminated duplication across documents
- ✅ Established single sources of truth:
  - SOLID principles → architecture.md
  - Refactoring examples → ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW.md
  - Service patterns → services/patterns.md
  - Command patterns → commands/patterns.md
  - Testing patterns → testing-strategy.md, services/testing-guide.md, commands/testing-guide.md
  - File organization → CLAUDE.md, contributing.md

**Link Verification** (Phase 6.1):
- ✅ 584 markdown links verified
- ✅ 4 broken links fixed:
  - regeneration_plan.md: game-design.md paths corrected
  - game_design_document_refactor_plan.md: game-design.md paths corrected

**Document Size Verification** (Phase 6.2):
- ✅ CLAUDE.md: 422 lines (target: ~500 ✓)
- ✅ architecture.md: 1,223 lines (allowed exception)
- ✅ 8 documents over 500 lines (acceptable - focused technical references):
  - systems-advanced.md (822), commands/patterns.md (702), systems-core.md (656)
  - services/patterns.md (632), commands/testing-guide.md (605), services/creation-guide.md (546)
  - commands/creation-guide.md (541), testing-strategy.md (523)
- ✅ All serve as complete references (not god documents)

**Content Organization**:
- ✅ Moved 3 completed plans to docs/plans/ (light source, regeneration, game design refactor)
- ✅ Updated cross-references after moves
- ✅ Created plan catalog with status tracking

### SOLID Principles Applied to Documentation

**Single Responsibility Principle**:
- Each document has ONE topic
- services/creation-guide.md = ONLY creation steps
- services/patterns.md = ONLY common patterns
- services/testing-guide.md = ONLY testing approaches

**Open/Closed Principle**:
- Extend documentation by adding NEW files
- Don't modify existing complete guides
- Use cross-references to link related content

**Liskov Substitution Principle**:
- Guide documents substitutable (same structure, different topics)
- All creation guides follow same format
- All testing guides follow same AAA pattern

**Interface Segregation Principle**:
- Readers only see what they need
- Beginner path ≠ Advanced path
- Quick Start (30 min) vs Deep Dive (2 weeks)

**Dependency Inversion Principle**:
- High-level docs (README.md) link to low-level docs
- Concrete examples reference abstract principles
- Architecture principles reused across guides

---

### Metrics

**Before Refactor**:
- 2 god documents (4,364 lines combined)
- CLAUDE.md (873 lines, too large)
- No entry points for new developers
- Duplicate content across files
- Difficult to find specific information

**After Refactor**:
- 12 focused documents (4,908 lines, better organized)
- CLAUDE.md (422 lines, 51.6% reduction)
- 3 entry points (README.md, getting-started.md, contributing.md)
- Single sources of truth established
- Clear navigation paths
- Plan catalog and template
- Comprehensive root README.md

**Coverage**:
- 36,418 total lines of documentation
- 584 internal links verified
- 100% broken links fixed
- 5 archived plans organized

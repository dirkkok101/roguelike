## Gameplay Testing

### Healing Availability (Manual Testing Required)

- [ ] Depth 1: Find 5-6 healing potions per 5 levels
  - **Status**: Needs manual verification
  - **Expected**: ~10.8% spawn rate should yield 5-6 potions

- [ ] Depth 13: Find 4-5 healing potions per 5 levels
  - **Status**: Needs manual verification
  - **Expected**: ~10% spawn rate at peak

- [ ] Depth 26: Find 6-7 healing potions per 5 levels
  - **Status**: Needs manual verification
  - **Expected**: ~15.5% spawn rate (combined MAJOR + SUPERIOR)

### Regeneration Speed (Manual Testing Required)

- [ ] Depth 1: Regen ~10 HP in 100 turns
  - **Expected**: 100 turns ÷ 10 turns/HP = 10 HP
  - **Status**: Needs manual verification

- [ ] Depth 26: Regen ~20 HP in 100 turns
  - **Expected**: 100 turns ÷ 5 turns/HP = 20 HP (2× faster)
  - **Status**: Needs manual verification

### Combat Balance (Manual Testing Required)

- [ ] Healing potions cover 50-100% of typical combat damage
  - **MINOR_HEAL (5d8)**: Avg 22.5 HP
  - **MEDIUM_HEAL (8d10)**: Avg 44 HP
  - **MAJOR_HEAL (12d10)**: Avg 66 HP
  - **SUPERIOR_HEAL (15d12)**: Avg 97.5 HP
  - **Status**: Needs manual verification

- [ ] Resource drain during rest is manageable
  - Hunger consumption while resting ✓
  - Light fuel consumption while resting ✓
  - Status: Needs manual verification

---

## Balance Validation (Design Goals)

### No Resource Starvation

- [x] Mathematical validation: Spawn rates ensure adequate supply
  - Depth 1: 10.8% vs 3.5% baseline (3.1× improvement) ✓
  - Depth 26: 15.5% vs 3.5% baseline (4.4× improvement) ✓

- [ ] Gameplay validation: Players can sustain 26-level journey
  - **Status**: Needs manual playtesting

### Healing Doesn't Trivialize Combat

- [x] Power scaling appropriate for depth
  - MINOR_HEAL (5d8 avg 22.5) for depths 1-10 ✓
  - MEDIUM_HEAL (8d10 avg 44) for depths 8-18 ✓
  - MAJOR_HEAL (12d10 avg 66) for depths 15-27 ✓
  - SUPERIOR_HEAL (15d12 avg 97.5) for depths 20-27 ✓

- [ ] Combat remains challenging despite healing availability
  - **Status**: Needs manual playtesting

### Resting Remains Risky But Viable

- [x] Regeneration speed scales with depth (50% faster at depth 26)
- [x] Hunger/light drain continues during rest
- [ ] Risk/reward balance feels tactical
  - **Status**: Needs manual playtesting

### Smooth Progression

- [x] Tier transitions overlap appropriately
  - MINOR → MEDIUM overlap: depths 8-10 ✓
  - MEDIUM → MAJOR overlap: depths 15-18 ✓
  - MAJOR + SUPERIOR together: depths 20-27 ✓

- [x] No sudden difficulty spikes from healing unavailability
  - Spawn rate curves are smooth (bell curves, linear ramps) ✓

- [ ] Progression feels rewarding
  - **Status**: Needs manual playtesting

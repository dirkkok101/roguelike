## Quick Test Checklist

**Minimum tests to verify all fixes**:

- [ ] Aquator rusts armor
- [ ] Ice Monster freezes player
- [ ] Leprechaun steals gold and flees
- [ ] Medusa confuses player
- [ ] Nymph steals item and flees
- [ ] Rattlesnake drains strength
- [ ] Vampire drains max HP and regenerates
- [ ] Venus Flytrap holds player
- [ ] Wraith drains XP
- [ ] Bat moves erratically (if spawned in open room)
- [ ] Orc prioritizes gold

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Monster ability doesn't trigger"
- **Check**: Does the ability have a % chance? Try multiple hits
- **Check**: Run tests with `npm test MonsterTurnService/theft-mechanics` to verify code works
- **Check**: Verify `monsters.json` has correct flag name (e.g., `"rusts_armor"` not `"rust_armor"`)

**Issue**: "Bat doesn't look erratic"
- **Reason**: Bat has speed 15 (very fast), moves ~2x per turn. Hard to see individual moves.
- **Solution**: Watch in large open room, stand still for 10+ turns

**Issue**: "Leprechaun/Nymph won't steal"
- **Check**: Are they adjacent? They need to be next to you (not diagonal)
- **Check**: Do you have gold/items? They won't steal if you have nothing
- **Verify**: Tests pass with `npm test theft-mechanics`

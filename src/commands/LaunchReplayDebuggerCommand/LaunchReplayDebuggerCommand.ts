/**
 * LaunchReplayDebuggerCommand - Launch replay debugger for current game
 *
 * Purpose: Opens the console-based replay debugger for the current game.
 *
 * Orchestration:
 * 1. Check if replay data exists (via ReplayDebuggerService)
 * 2. If exists, push ReplayDebugState onto state stack
 * 3. User can step through replay, validate determinism, etc.
 *
 * Usage (from debug mode):
 * ```typescript
 * // Press 'r' in debug mode
 * const command = new LaunchReplayDebuggerCommand(
 *   replayDebugger,
 *   stateManager
 * )
 * const newState = command.execute(gameState)
 * ```
 *
 * **Architecture Notes**:
 * - This is a Command (orchestration) not a Service (business logic)
 * - Coordinates ReplayDebuggerService + GameStateManager
 * - Pushes new state onto stack (modal overlay pattern)
